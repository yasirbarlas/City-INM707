# INM707: Deep Reinforcement Learning

Note: This repository and its contents support the coursework of the INM707 module at City, University of London.

## Basic Tasks

We create a Gridworld-like environment using NumPy and Matplotlib. The environment specifically looks at an agent traversing a single-story house (or apartment), with the aim of cleaning the carpets of the house. We refer to the agent as a robot vacuum cleaner. The agent receives a positive reward for cleaning carpets, a negative reward for bumping into walls/furniture or trying to escape the grid, a negative reward for moving onto states with cables/wires, and lastly a positive reward for entering the terminal state (a charging station).

The relevant Jupyter Notebook can be found in the [basic-tasks](../main/basic-tasks) folder.
